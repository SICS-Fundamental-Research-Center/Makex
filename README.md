# Overview
Makex (MAKE senSE) is a logic approach to explaining why a GNN-based model M(x,y) recommends item y to user x. It proposes a class of Rules for ExPlanations, denoted as REPs and defined with a graph pattern Q and dependency X â†’ M(x,y), where X is a collection of predicates, and the model M(x,y) is treated as the consequence of the rule. Intuitively, given M(x,y), we discover pattern Q to identify relevant topology, and precondition X to disclose correlations, interactions and dependencies of vertex features; together they provide rationals behind prediction M(x,y), identifying what features are decisive for M to make predictions and under what conditions the decision can be made. We (a) define REPs with 1-WL test, on which most GNN models for recommendation are based; (b) develop an algorithm for discovering REPs for M as global explanations, and (c) provide a top-k algorithm to compute top-ranked local explanations.
